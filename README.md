## My First Portfolio.
####
#### This has 4 sections. They are as follows,
    HOME
    PROJECTS
    ABOUT
    BLOGS

#### Written using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript and hosted on Netlify.
#### CSS is for styling while I used Javascript to switch between dark theme and light theme
#### This also uses browsers local storage to save the users' preferred theme so that he does not need to change theme everytime the page is refereshed or reopened.
