            <h2>Hey there!<span id="handwave">ðŸ‘‹</span></h2>
            <p>First of all, thanks for hanging out on my website even though its boring. I know.</p>
            <p>I am <strong>Nikhil</strong>, which you probably know, If you are reading this and I'm 25! which means nothing actually.</p>
            <p>I like playing around with Tech and travelling as well. I recently completed my first solo and I'll be writing about it soon.</p>
            <p>Now, when it comes to web development journey, I fell on this path by chance. Not true. I just googled arund the highest paid jobs in the world and came across Data Science, Analytics, App and Web Dev. Ruled out the first as I'm not so good at Statistics and Analytics never interested me.</p>
            <p>I was interested in App dev but I don't exactly remeber why I chose Web. I was like, I'll become full stack web dev in 6 months and earn in lakhs and live the rest of my life happily. But that was not the case.</p>
            <p>When I got started I was struggling with everything, which I even do now. But during my initial stages I was running after money and not the job. I was not passionate about it.</p>
            <p>This changed very quickly due to the awesome web dev community and a support of my friend. One thing that I learnt is that this is not a destination, it's a JOURNEY. We have to constantly run and learn new things and connect with people almost eveyday.</p>
            <p>This is what started motivating me. I started asking for help, learn't how to GOOGLE and helped others whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Now, I learn because I like what I do, I'm passionate about it and no amount of money can give you that.</p>
            <p> Even you can do this, Just be positive, passionate and a life long learner.</p>
            <h4>Always ready to connect.</h4>
            <h3>See You Around!</h3>
