                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <p>Hey there!</p>
                <p>First of all, thanks for hanging out on my website even though its boring. I know.</p>
                <p>I am Nikhil, which you probably know, If you are reading this and I'm 25! which means nothing actually.</p>
                <p>I like playing around with Tech and travelling as well. I recently completed my first solo and I'll be writing about it soon.</p>
                <p>Now, when it comes to web development journey, I fell on this path by chance. Not true. I just googled arund the highest paid jobs in the world and came across Data Science, Analytics, App and Web Dev. Ruled out the first I'm not so good at statistics and Analytics never interested me.</p>
                <p>I was interested in App dev but I don't exactly remeber why I chose Web. I was like, I'll become full stack web dev in 6 months and earn in lakhs and live the rest of my life happily.</p>
                <p>When I got started I was struggling with everything, which I even do now. But duing my initial stages I was running after money and not the job. I was not passionate about it.</p>
                <p>This changed very quickly due to the awesome web dev community and a support of my friend. One thing that I learnt is that this is not a destination, its a JOURNEY. We have to constantly run and learn new things and connect with people almost eveyday.</p>
                <p>This is what started motivating me. I started asking for help, learn't how to GOOGLE and helped others whenever possible.</p>
                <p>Now, I learn because I like what I do, I'm passionate about it and no amount of money can give you that.</p>
                <p>And I do all this while having a 9-5, So, even you can do this. Just be positive, passionate and a life long learner.</p>
                <p>Also, Dont forget to take breaks. Always available to connect and discuss. </p>
                <h3>See You Around!.</h3>

                <h2>Hoisting in JavaScript</i></h2>
                <p><strong>Hoisting</strong> is a phenomenon in which JavaScript magicallyðŸ¤º moves the code to the top.</p>
                <p>Well, not really.</p>
                <p>But programming is not magic. There lies a logic. So, lets actually see how actually HOISTING works.</p>
                <p>We know that when we run a script, a Global Execution Context (GEC) is created which consists of two phases. Memory creation phase and Execution phases i.e. run phase.
                    During this memory creation phase all the magic happens.As soon as we run a script all the all the variables and functions are allocated space in the memory. This happens even before the first line of code is executed. This is the reason we are able to call/access functions or variables on a line which is before their initialization and not face any errors. </p>
                    <p>Don't believe me? Check out the below written acticle where I explain <strong>Hoisting</strong> in-depth.</p>

                <h2>How to add Dark Mode to a website.</h2>
                <p>Every website should have a DARK MODE toggle.</p>
                <p> As most of the time we as developers, spend hours and hours working in front of our screens, having a dark theme option to a website will reduce the amount of eye strain during long sessions especially during the night.</p>
                <p>So, lets take a look at how to add dark-theme toggle to a website using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Here, we'll also be using browser's local Storage to save the preferred state of the developer. This means that no matter how many times the page is reloaded or even closed, the browser will automatically switch the theme to dev's previous preferred state.</p>
